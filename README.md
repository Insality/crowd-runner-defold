### About
The example was created from this video:
![](media/ref_video.mp4)

And we tried to build the same stuff on _Defold_. For now it's kind of example and benchmark to see how we can use a lot of entities at once time.

The example have two toggler:
- `Skip update` - the entities, which far away from player call update less frequently (up to zero times)
- `Draw outside` - the sprite's entities which far away from player is disabled. You can check how it's affects on game performance


### Control:
WASD or touch the screen for move
P - Profiler
Or use on-screen buttons
